# Face_Recognition

To run the Facial Recognition model:-
Step 1: Download zip file and extract it to specific folder.
Step 2: Download libraries such as Tensorflow>=2.0.0 and Keras>=2.0.0, for this you can use pip install command in python.
step 3: Then open command prompt and run python Face_Rec.py now your Facial Recognition code will be executed.

To make sure run time is as low as possible I have used only photos of two persons to show how code works. If you want to add multiple user you just need to add photos in images folder and make some changes in Face_Rec.py file.
